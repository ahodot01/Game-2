Game / Numbers / Socket Programming
Used Python to write a game based on Socket Programming. The game is a competition between two client instances that interact with each other through the server. Each participant submits an integer ranging from 0 to 9. If the two numbers vary by 3 or less, the participant who submitted the higher number emerges as the winner. In contrast, if the two numbers differs by 4 or more, the participant who submitted the lower number emerges as the winner. In the event that the two numbers are equivalent, a draw occurs. Can be used/tested via 3 instances of Command Prompt in single/same computer: one for server and two for 2 players. Can be slightly adjusted to be used on separate computers via changing IP/PORT details.
