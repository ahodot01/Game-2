<h1>Game-2</h1>

<p>
  Minimal game project based on Socket Programming. The game is a competition between two client instances that interact with each other through the server. 
Each participant submits an integer ranging from 0 to 9. If the two numbers vary by 3 or less, the participant who submitted the higher number emerges as the winner. 
In contrast, if the two numbers differs by 4 or more, the participant who submitted the lower number emerges as the winner. In the event that the two numbers are 
equivalent, a draw occurs. Can be used/tested via 3 instances of Command Prompt in single/same computer: one for server and two for 2 players. Lightweight, terminal-friendly, and easy to tweak.
